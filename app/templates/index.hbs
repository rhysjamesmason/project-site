  <h1 class='uk-heading-small'><strong>DVLA STEM Programme</strong></h1>
  <p>The DVLA STEM Programme is a volunteer-led initiative, supported by DVLA.
    The programme was founded in 2014 to promote STEM (Science, Technology,
    Engineering and Mathematics) subjects and grass roots learning, from primary
    schools through to sixth form and college students, throughout Wales. Since
    then, the programme has grown considerably. We run competitions and events
    for all primary and secondary schools in Wales, donating hundreds of
    thousands of pounds to schools across the country. We achieve this with the
    support of DVLA and our generous sponsors. The STEM programme helps children
    learn the fundamentals of STEM subjects and shows the opportunities they
    have for the future.</p>
  <p class='uk-margin-large'>These are just some of the Projects DVLA is working
    on this year. Check out our
