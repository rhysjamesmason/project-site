  <h1><strong>What&apos;s On</strong></h1>
  <p class='uk-margin'>The DVLA STEM Programme runs several events and projects
    throughout the year. The main focus is always to benefit the community
    across Wales, by providing fun and educational activities and events for
    children and young adults aged 7 to 18, and by helping other organisations
    with their own STEM projects. All our projects are led by our STEM
    volunteers. If you work for DVLA, you will have the opportunity to get
    involved with many different events, from national competitions like the
    DVLA Code Challenge, to individual school hosting days or after school
    clubs.</p>

  <p class='uk-margin'>Click on any of the links below to find out more about
    the events and projects we are running this year.</p>

  <p class='uk-margin'>We believe that Wales has the potential to lead in
    technology and innovation both now and in the future. These projects are
    just some of the ways that DVLA is helping communities and investing in
    future generations of technologists.</p>
